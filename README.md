The S-Puzzle is a type of sliding-Tiles puzzle played on a n-by-n grid, with numbers
occupying the cells. In the Tile game, S-Puzzle There is no space; all n2 tiles are occupied. The game is
played by swapping any two adjacent tiles, where adjacency is defined grid-wise (diagonal tiles are not
adjacent) and does not wrap around. Like in the original Sliding Tiles puzzle, the goal of the S-Puzzle is to
arrange the numbers in ascending order.

The goal of the 3-by-3 S-Puzzle is to reach: 

1 | 2 | 3
